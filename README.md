Donate us 1$ if you like this project, thanks! [![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.me/jumpingyang/1)

Our Official site is http://GitTest.com, currently it is only a demo site!

This is open souce project, I want to do a service like GitHub.Com, but it is for testing management.

It should include test plan, test case, test step, test result, test case result, etc, and might provider API for calling in the future.

Since I don't have ability to make this come ture, so I create this open source project here and I am hoping that anyone who is interesting with this can help improve this demo, thanks very much for help!
